# CALCULATIONS I WANT TO MAKE
    # Figure out why I can't have both men and women's bf cateogry displayed at the same time (My first guess is it has to do with state)
    # Understand bodyfat category function more
# CHECK WHY VERCEL ISN'T WORKING 
# FIGURE OUT WHY ARRAY OF STRINGS IN COLUMNS MATCHES NUMBER DATA IN TABLE COMPONENT
# FIGURE OUT WHEN TO USE DYNAMIC SQL QUERIES
# CREATE AUTH FOR BODYFAT APPLICATION
